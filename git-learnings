Git is a version control tool. Github is a central repository where it allows to store your code.

--> 2 types of repository Central and Local.

Making changes --  status, add, commit
Parallel dev -- branch, merge, rebase
Syncing repository -- add origin, push, pull

--> If ur working on a completely new project and if u want some thing fresh/ very new u can use git init to create a repository or if u want to join exisitng projecct u can git clone to download the repository

-->  what is .gitignore ?
.gitignore - ther might be some files you dont want, when u r making operations like pull /push ex: log files . You dont want those files to get pushed / pulled. Those files we can add it in gitignore.
